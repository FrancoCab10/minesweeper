# Minesweeper

  - This project was made with Angular 8.0.3
  - I spent about 4hs 30mins programming and testing, and 15 more minutes to do this README along with some minor adjustments to improve performance and correct some semantic errors.
  - I made the entire project in English because the challenge instructions are too.
  - I was able to finish it all with no mayor issues within the 5hs limit, including the time testing and a 30mins rest after the first 2hs.

## Aditional note:

  The app is finished and correctly working.
  It can be built for production using `ng build --prod` and served in any web server.
